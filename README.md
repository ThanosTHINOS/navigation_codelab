How It Works
1. First Screen:

Displays an AppBar with the title "First Screen".
A button labeled "Go to Second Screen" navigates to the Second Screen using the named route /second.

2. Second Screen:

Displays an AppBar with the title "Second Screen".
A button labeled "Go Back to First Screen" navigates back to the First Screen using Navigator.pop().

3. Named Routes:

Named routes (/ for First Screen, /second for Second Screen) are defined in main.dart, making navigation scalable and easy to manage.
